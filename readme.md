Bucket of stuff
=========

This repo has a collection of scripts that I may find useful or possibly future ideas/works-in-progress.

If you're just browsing powershell, you may also consider looking at my [PSProfile][0] repo as well...

What's worth looking at?
=========
- Take a look at the [devInstall.ps1][1] script. This is a single powershell script that I run once to setup my windows development environment.
